	 <p>
	 
	 Duham House of pets is an international started long ago, approximately 20 years ago.It was founded <br/>
	 by Dr Mercy Johnson.Dr Mercy had discovered countless importance of pets during her time as a freelancer
	 resercher in one of the biggest medical companies in USA.<br/>Dr Mercy discovered that, pets mostly dogs 
	 have the ability to reduce high pressure in old men and women.Apart from high blood pressure, dogs
	 among other pets played impotant role in homes, though many people had not yet discovered their importances.
	 <br/><br/>
	 
	 Dr mercy started to keep many pets in her home.She strongly believed that one daya one time, people will
	 come to realise how pets are the most important animals to keep in our homes.It was after the end of her 
	 research when she decided to build a small pets house.Her major aim was to treat her pets with great care.
	 <br/><br/>
	 
	 The small village became her school. She tought every one who came to her home about pets.As time moved by
	 people learned more about pets and started to keep them in their homes.As a result of this, Dr Mercy
	 sow the need for a a well stable source of food for the pets.<br/>
	 
	 She therefore started a small scale store, which sold pets food, medicines and other prodcuts.5 years leter
	 the number of pets keepers had increased and so the need for more food.Selling foods at her home became
	 problematic and therefore she decided to move her store to the village centre which looks more like
	 a developed town.Her fast store took up very well and it grew faster.<br/>
	 
	 Dog apparel and cats toys were her idears.Many people got employed as her buisness expanded.
	 Jobless men and women got job in her food production area.
	 Currently, Dr Mercy has over 300 pet's food processing companies, She has employed over 5000 people and
	 not only pets are sold but she also sells pets products. <br/>
